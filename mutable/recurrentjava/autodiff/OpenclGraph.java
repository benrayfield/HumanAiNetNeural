/** As of 2020-11-7 this has never worked and is waiting on lazycl to be finished
cuz planning to use lazycl instead of dealing with opencl directly here.
TODO testcases that compare it, bit for bit (strictfp float), with CpuGraph.
<br><br>
A Graph implemented using OpenCL. A Graph is a mutable builder of numberCrunching ops with backprop (and in some cases also training) built in.
TODO: OpenCL optimized autodiff, including forward, backprop, and training,
such as learning in a recurrent GruLayer with 5 FeedForwardLayers above it.
<br><br>
See comment of OpenclGraph.doWork for how to use this as it has different requirements than CpuGraph.
Calculations are delayed and you can optimize them by setIsTemp.
<br><br>
Strictfp is just a semantic here since the calculations are actually done in opencl used with strict compile options
and should (in theory, todo verify in TestAutodiffCpuVsGpu*) compute the exact same bits.
<br><br>
As Runnable, it does the calculations, reading and writing in multiple Matrixs.
<br><br>
Cuz multiple opencl ndrange kernels are done at once before returning to CPU/java,
the contents of Matrixs (which each contain 3 lazyevaled FSyMems) are lazyEvaled,
but FIXME that lazyEval might not be lazy triggered and instead depend on some other code
calling OpenclUtil.callOpenclDependnet on some transform of OpenclGraph.dependnet()
which will be done in (TODO) OpenclGraph.eval() or something like that,
which will use the DependParams in the FSyMems (sy means DependParam as symbol)
matching that with the DependParams in the Set<DependOp> returned by dependnet(),
to know which FloatBuffers (in the FSymMems in the Matrixs) to copy between opencl and Matrix.
<br><br>
OLD...
<br><br>
TODO This delays calculation of Graph until its built
then does the whole thing in OpenclUtil.callOpenclForest(...).
<br><br>
This should run at low lag since on my computer opencl can do
1700 seqential ndrange kernels (one after the other) per second
when blocks of 30 kernels are done before returning to java,
or 100 kernels per second if returning to java after each kernel.
<br><br>
RecurrentJava's GruLayer and LstmLayer etc are wasteful
in creating array for every multiply and add, so
TODO write kernels that do the whole neuralnode in 1 kernel
(multiplied by how many time steps) and between that do matmul,
and write the backprop specific to each node type
based on the multiple inputs to each node (derive output value(s) of
that node from those inputs) and backpropping from the outputs 
<br><br>
Matrix is compatible with delayed eval (not as well organized as lazyeval),
or potentially lazyeval but leave that upgrade for later,
since it uses FSyMem objects which lazy create FloatBuffer
and their DependParam (SYmbol) is used in OpenclUtil.callOpenclDependnet
to refer to CLMem objects that most of them dont have FloatBuffer.
<br><br>
Every returned Matrix contains FSyMems whose FloatBuffer hasnt been filled yet.
Its filled all at once, among many Matrix, using the task lists in OpenclGraph.

				Think of some examples that could break whatever design I'm considering about this.
				Whatever order of the calls of Graph.java (and this subclass of it),
				there is a calculation done by the DependOps if run in that order,
				and the dependnet must be defined (this DependOp[] here is 1 node's direct dependencies) as
				every possible order which does the same calculation.
				I only have to think about depth 2 outward, such as 2 DependOps that touch the same DependParam,
				one of them reading and one of them readWriting, to make sure that even though that DependParam is
				finished being written by things earlier than those 2 DependOps,
				those 2 DependOps cant run at the same time since it must be readMany_or_writeOne_or_nothing at each
				DependParam at each moment. Find a way to convert List<DependOp> to a dependnet.
				Also upgrade OpenclUtil.callOpenclDependnet to give the dependnet to opencl in a way that
				opencl can do multiple openclNdrangeKernels in parallel (maybe using multiple CLQueue etc)
				instead of computing a single order of the DependOps to do all in 1 CLQueue.
				But first, find a way to convert List<DependOp> to a dependnet, and use it to convert that List
				to a dependnet so openclNdrangeKernels can run it.
				Then, after gru neuralnet is working, add 2 new funcs to OpenclGraph (and Graph)
				which do an array of grunodes or array of lstmnodes (1 func for each) in a single openclNdrangeKernel
				to reduce lag compared to a kernel for multiply, a kernel for plus, etc.
				For each DependParam, alternate ReadLock ReadWrite_or_Write_Lock,
				and use those as part of the dependnet, where DependOps have those as childs,
				BUT... some of those must have DependOps as childs,
				like if dependOpD has readWriteLock on paramXAtItsCycle4 (read=1 rw=2 read=3 rw=4)
				then read=5 is paramX's 5th form and it must have dependOpD as its child.
				I'm unsure if theres an obvious best way to do this or if I'll have to
				have it jiggle the possible dependnets around until it finds something
				between the best possible solution and the List of 1 DependOp at a time.
				Either way Opencl will run faster, that is at least on computers that
				can do multiple kernels at once.
				...
				FIXME, not a complete design yet: Planned solution:
				Each DependParam is used in a linkedlist that alternates Read vs WriteAndOptionallyRead, each wrapped in a DependOp.
				DependParam x = ...;
				DependOp firstWrite = ...(x);
				DependOp firstRead = firstWrite.next();
				DependOp secondWrite = firstRead.next();
				DependOps such as matmul would have at most 1 of those for each DependParam as its childs.
				FIXME which of those (such as firstRead or secondWrite) should depend on a matmul?
				FIXME How to prevent depending on an earlier Read after its written, since these represent state changes of Mem?
				...
				Planned solution:
				create a new class, as a middle layer between OpenclGraph and OpenclUtil.callOpenclDependnet.
				That class will have a WeakHashMap<DependParam,LockState> and implement readMANY and WriteAndOptionallyReadONE,
				in any sequence of adding some anotherNewClass that creates a DependOp but doesnt know its dependencies yet,
				only knows a list of Lockpar (LockState and DependParam) and a code string.
				When one of those (that creates a DependOp) is added, it looks up all its DependParams in that WeakHashMap,
				and for each, if its already READ and the new is READ then it depends on that READ,
				or if its already READ and the new is a WRITEANDOPTIONALLYREAD then add a WRITEANDOPTIONALLYREAD that depends on
				all current readers, or if its already WRITEANDOPTIONALLYREAD then add a READ which depends on that WRITEANDOPTIONALLYREAD
				then depend on that READ. Update the WeakHashMap whenever a DependOp's LockState changes.
				Every DependParam starts as LockState.noLock, so it can go next to READ or WRITEANDOPTIONALLYREAD.
				WRITEANDOPTIONALLYREAD means either of LockState.readWriteLock or LockState.writeLock.
				This will generate
